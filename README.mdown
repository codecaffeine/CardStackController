# Card Stack View Controller
## About
An example UIViewController container that allows you to view multilpe viewControllers at once by minimizing them all. You can move these minimized views around and swipe them off-screen to remove them. You can also tap on a minimized viewController to bring it to focus.

## Requirements
I've only tested this with Xcode 4.2+ so I don't know if it'll work < 4.2.

## API
